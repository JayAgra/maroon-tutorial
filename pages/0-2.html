        <p>Welcome to Intro to Robot Programming! This course will teach you about the basics of how to program one of the M-A Robotics Team’s robots. After we cover the basics in this course, subsequent courses will go into more detail about topics like mechanism control and computer vision.</p>
        <p>Every year, the Robotics Team builds several robots, some for use in competitions and some to try out new ideas or develop our capabilities as a team. It is the programming team’s job to create the software that runs on those robots and makes them behave in the right way. The code we write has several responsibilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The robots include a variety of mechanisms like arms, grippers, and ball shooters. We make these mechanisms useful and efficient by automating common operations. For example, an arm mechanism is much more useful if the robot can raise it to a certain height on its own.</li>
            <li>Our robots are operated by human drivers who remotely control them using a set of joysticks, buttons, and switches. We work with the drivers to develop the best way to set up those controls: code defines how the robot responds when each of those joysticks and buttons is pressed.</li>
            <li>There is also a portion of each match, called Autonomous Mode, where the human drivers are not allowed to control the robots. During this period, the robots must be able to operate solely by following the program we’ve created. Each year, we work to develop new and more complex capabilities that our robots can perform on their own.</li>
        </ul>
